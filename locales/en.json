    "pageSubtitle": "A journey through centuries of Georgian winemaking tradition",
    "storyTitle": "The Mogzauri Heritage",
    "storyText": "Founded in 2023, Mogzauri Wine Cellar draws upon millennia of Georgian winemaking wisdom. The name \"Mogzauri\" — meaning \"traveler\" in Georgian — reflects our journey to bring the world's oldest wine tradition to modern connoisseurs. Our estate sits upon some of Georgia's most prized terroir, where the unique combination of climate, altitude, and soil composition creates wines of extraordinary character.",
    "philosophyTitle": "Our Philosophy",
    "philosophyText": "We embrace the ancient Georgian method of fermenting wine in qvevri — large clay vessels buried in the earth. This UNESCO-recognized technique allows the wine to develop complex flavors through natural temperature regulation and gentle oxidation. Every step of our process honors the land and the legacy it carries.",
    "vineyardTitle": "The Vineyard",
    "vineyardText": "Our vineyards span across carefully selected plots, each chosen for its unique microclimate and soil profile. We cultivate indigenous Georgian grape varieties — Saperavi, Rkatsiteli, and Kisi — alongside select international cultivars, creating wines that are distinctly Georgian yet universally celebrated.",
    "craftTitle": "Craft & Tradition",
    "craftText": "From hand-harvesting at optimal ripeness to aging in Georgian oak and qvevri, every decision reflects our commitment to uncompromising quality. Our winemaker combines generations of knowledge with modern precision, ensuring each vintage expresses the true essence of its origin."
